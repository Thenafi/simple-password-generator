Simplest password generator.

Just a stupidly simple password generator.

There is no single simple password generator, so I built my own. ðŸ˜Š

There was always something with each website. Like, I need to create a button to generate one, or I need to select options to include characters. There were pop-ups, sliders, and other unnecessary crap.

But mine just literally generates a password on each page load, and you can use Tab+Space to copy it. No other hassle. ðŸ˜Š
